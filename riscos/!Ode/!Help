 INSTRUCTIONS: Load it and click on the "Next Ode" button a bit.
   To add your own words, open the file for the type of word you want to add
    then type your word at the end and save it. For nouns the word needs to
    be entered then a number separated by a comma. The meaning of the numbers
    is: 0=the 1=a 2=an 3=some 4=(nothing) 5=my These words will precede the
    word in the sentence.
 Note, in some places magenta and yellow have been replaced by red and blue, 
  as magenta cannot be produced on a 16 colour desktop and yellow was
  unreadable.
  
History:
Version 2.0 (23,2,94)
 Second line added. 
Version 2.1 (18,7,94)
Transferred from the Beeb in December 1994
Version 3.1 (with word wrapping) completed 9,8,94 (version transferred)
Version 3.49 (Much neater but still with noun bug) completed 9,5,95 for
 Mark Hiscott (Who complained about it always saying "Ode to the romans who
 I cut out of a magazine one midsummer morning" (Which has been fixed))
 PseudoMultiTasking Ode (runs in a Task Window)
Version 3.61
 The very first fully multi-tasking version!!
 Completed 15,6,95 version 3.61 now takes its words from the text files:
  nouns, verbs, adjs and ings inside the application directory.
 Still with the noun bug (a result of writing it on a Beeb, another result is
  that all the text is in upper case)
Version 3.62
 Now with menus!! (and the noun bug)
Version 4.10 (I think, but I have probably missed some)
 Noun bug removed! and so has the big sprite at the top because it took too
 long to load and too much memory etc. Puts an icon on the icon bar and
 renamed from !MultiOde back to the original !Ode. Can now save odes as text 
 files using dragging and dropping.
Version 4.12
 All new icons (designed in draw then snapshoted). Icons are reiconsprited on
 mode change (including 32000+ colour modes). Text now in lower case.
Version 4.51 (12 Jan 1996)
 Word database added for easy adding/deleteing of words (this is essentialy a
 different program, it has it's own poll loop).
Version 4.52 (02 Apr 1996)
 A lot more CPU efficient, changed from using about 40% of processor time to
 less than 0.0%.
Version 4.60 (14 Apr 1996)
 Removed reiconspriteing and 32000 colour icon as they were a pointless waste
 of time and memory, plus other stuff.
Version 4.61 (23 Jul 1996)
 Fixed two bugs.
Version 4.65 (23 Jul 1996)
 Vastly improved handling of plurals following rules in Collins English
 Dictionary.
Version 5.00 (14 Feb 1997)
 All words put into catagories which can be turned on or off as needed, also
 the noun in the first line can be specified using a writable menu option.
Version 5.01 (21 Feb 1997)
 Saves Odes directly into other programs (via Scrap).
